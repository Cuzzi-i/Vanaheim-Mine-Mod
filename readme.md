# What are we looking for?
When i am looking to make a mod that adds a little bit of content, some tools or weapons but without exploding the normal Minecraft real.
## Objectives
Make a mod that is funny and hard, i mean i don't want to make a mod that you can not pass but i want a mod that is hard but possible for newbies and is enough so a acknowledge player can have fun with it.

# MOD
So, the mod is going to be separated in 4 or 5 themes inside, 
- Forest/Nature 
- Nether/Crimson
- End/Skulk/Void
- Ocean/Coral
- Misc

---
### Forest/Nature
Simple items, some tricky ones, but not really so powerful, mining utilities, foods, animals and maybe some mobs but not much.
[[ForestItems]]

### Nether/Crimson
Cursed and power items, not really destroying the balance, but items that can give you powerful buffs or de-buffs. Some mobs is a obligation.
[[CrimsonItems]]


### End/Crimson/Void
Powerful creatures, disease, corruption, and dungeons, loot will be items that are for killing and for mobility
[[VoidItems]]

### Ocean
Ocean and coral items will be few, and are about mobility and commodity not a problem with any progression.
